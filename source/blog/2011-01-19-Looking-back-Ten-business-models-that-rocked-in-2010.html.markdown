Of course Groupon ranks high, the same business model adoped by 
[Koopon](http://www.koopon.ca/) here in Canada. 
[Kikckstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) represents for me one of the best business ou there, truly embracing the root and the culture of the Internet. 
[Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) is something I have bee looking at for a few years now (as a user), a more sophisticated version of couch surfing.
