Currently working on a partnership with 
[GeneratedPaper](http://www.generatedpaper.com/) to transform digital templates and mockups for the iPhone, iPad, Web browser window to high-quality notebooks for Artists.

The intent is to make notebooks for web designer, application developer, designer, movie producer, illustrator...We want to build unique notebooks that all creative brains can carry on the go and help them sketch, prototype, mockup, draw...anywhere anytime. Something you will proud to keep around, showcase first iterations and initial inspiration but also share to make it happen.

We put together a very short 
[survey](http://generatedpaper.wufoo.com/forms/notebooks-for-creative-minds/) for all to help us get a good understanding of your needs and expectations. Â Link to the 
[6 questions poll](http://generatedpaper.wufoo.com/forms/notebooks-for-creative-minds/).
