Here is what keeps us busy these days: making our life simpler. How, by developing a simple but productive tool to track time, send invoices, manage projects and record payments. We're currently 
[polishing the invoicing piece](http://getprojectlog.com/blog/2011/11/15/send-invoices-with-projectlog/) that should be ready in a couple of weeks. 
[Projectlog](http://getprojectlog.com/) is a web-based application dedicated to people who want to stay on top of their business and simply access key information like (When is my invoice due? How much budget did I burn? Did I receive payment for this invoice? How many days left on this contract? Where is my timesheet?...).

Check out some of the 
[screenshots](http://getprojectlog.com/screenshots/) and contact us if you want an invitation to beta.
