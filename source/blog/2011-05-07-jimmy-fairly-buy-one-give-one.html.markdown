[Jimmy Fairly](http://www.jimmyfairly.com/) website is up and running and it's a good thing. The French startup sells vision and sunglasses online but with a very inspiring twist. Buy one, Give one is their slogan and concept. For every pair sold Jimmy will donate one to an association that will deliver to people in need. Unique price of 95 euros. They squeeze intermediaries to be able to propose such price.
This is a really neat e-business concept that can be applied to lots of domains. I'am sure these initiatives will grow and will find their audience because innovation is part of every e-business sites.

Plus it doesn't hurt to have a stunning logo (just my opinion). 
[Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/) is a similar company based in the US.
