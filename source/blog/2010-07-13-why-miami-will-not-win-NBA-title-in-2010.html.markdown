Now that the auto-proclaimedÂ King made his decision for next year, Miami, for those who don't follow, what can we learn from the 2010 Free-agency?

* Miami will unlikely win championship next year (but will sell more jerseys than ever)

* Bosh stats will drop as he won't get the ball

* Curious to see how Dwyane and Lebron will share the ball and shot tickets

* Who is going to join these 3 guys to be role player?

* Nike (shoes) has these 3 guys under contract

* What is the Toronto Raptors getting in return?
