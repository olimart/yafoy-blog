Although this isn't exactly ours it totally represents our thoughts. Do yourself a favour and read 
[this post](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/100e2r/) from Information Architects back in...2006 on usability, browser standards and why you should increase font size. Focus on content and readability. That's it.

It is challenging every day to convince clients/partners/colleagues but it's totally worth it: scrolling is OK, busy pages don't look better, we're not wasting white spacing we only put the essential information in front of your eyes, and so on.Happy reading!
