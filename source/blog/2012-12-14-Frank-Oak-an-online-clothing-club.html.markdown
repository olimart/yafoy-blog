I recently tested the concept of a fellow Canadian startup based in Montréal. 
[Frank & Oak](http://frankandoak.com/) aims at becoming your personal tailor without all the brick & mortar constraints. Indeed, they offer a selection of clothes for men online but tailored to your style. Sign up, define your clothing preference and then browse the selected items. Collection is updated every month.

But wait, there is more. The real benefit comes when you join the "Hunt Club" where you can order up to 3 items every month risk-free. Receive a nice crate with your items so you can lazily try them on from the comfort of your place. Keep whatever you want and return the rest. You only get charged for what you keep, shipping both ways is being taken care of. Sweet. Rinse and repeat every month.

From an e-commerce perspective I'd be curious to know about items retention rate. Overall great experience and interesting to see innovative concepts even though some "hurdles" need to be taken into consideration (package pick up at Canada Post if you missed it, recurring billing so you need to shop the first days of each month, and of course the eternal problems of size, colours...).

Stay tuned for more box-delivered-to-you-every-month concepts this year. I already said enough for the moment...
