We recently blogged about a cool e-business from Montreal aka 
[Frank & Oak](http://blog.yafoy.com/2012/12/frank-oak-online-clothing-club/).

Today we'd like to do the same about 
[Spacebox](https://spacebox.io). Pitch is simple, have something to sell online (digital or classic goods), you can now collect money in minutes. No coding necessary. It even handles recurring payments.

Here is how it works. For the most savvy readers it relies on 
[stripe](http://stripe.com) to process payments. Stripe has really made an easy job Â for developers to integrate secure payments into an app. Spacebox just adds a gorgeous User Interface to manage it all (form, products, members...). At first, there was stripe which introduced an easy-to-use payment processor for programmers but Spacebox brought it to the mass since anyone can create a product and share a link with clients to complete payment.

Design is also stunning and minimalist so you can get started in no time. Drew Wilson blogged about the concept and how he made it 
[happen in just 5 days](http://theindustry.cc/2012/10/19/space-box-behind-the-scenes/). It's worth a read. Design + Programming skills are key nowadays.


[Gumroad](http://gumroad.com) is also making a nice job in case you're looking for some options.
