Just finished reading Adam Bernhard's interview for 
[Entrepreneur](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217179) magazine. He runs 
[Hautelook](http://www.hautelook.com/) a member-only private-sales site and predicts glory to 
**discovery-based shopping**
. Â Privates sales are also huge in Europe led by vente-privee.com and allow retailers to get rid of old items but also go multi-canalals, approach new customers... (too many advantages for brands to go through the list).>They didn't even know they wanted to buy something

That's exactly what we're trying to do with 
[Koopon](http://www.koopon.ca). Because you bring something unique, fun and at a price you can't refuse you put customers into an ideal situation.

>What works best in terms of pricing? "Discount". The goal when we started was nothing less than 50-percent off.

Half-price off is so important to customers that you got start there and find the right balance with owners to break-even. This is key in that industry. Long way to go but we're working on it.
