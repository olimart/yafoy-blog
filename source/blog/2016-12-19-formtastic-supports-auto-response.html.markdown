This is the second major feature we are introducing in [Formtastic](https://formtastic.herokuapp.com), our very own back-end solution for web forms.

Auto response lets you send out an email reply when people submits your form. Just set the email body and we will write back on your behalf every time a new submission comes in.

A couple months ago we released integration with [Zapier](http://blog.yafoy.com/blog/2016/08/zapier-formtastic/) opening it up to all kinds of automated workflows by connecting your favourite services (Gmail, Mailchimp, Salesforce, Trello, Slack...).
