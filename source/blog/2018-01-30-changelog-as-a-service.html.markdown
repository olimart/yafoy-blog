Kicking off 2018 with a new product called Supportive combining both the functions of Knowledge Base and Changelog.

Looking back at this blog we've realized that we shipped a lot but did not write enough. As we all say, we'll do better next year. At least, we'll try.

Check out [Formtastic](https://formz.herokuapp.com) changelog rendered through a widget. We plan to improve widget's interaction with a preview of each announcement inline later in the year.

Happy coding!
