We've recently been asked to do more and more training sessions. Although days are pretty short lately squeezing a 2-hour training can still happen.

Talking 2 hours on things you like is not a big deal, it's all about preparation. Training material is key but the more content your produce the more you realize all the shortcuts you have embraced over the years.
