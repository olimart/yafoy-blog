We released 
[Timehub.me](http://timehub.me/)Â about 3 weeks ago. In case you missed it here is more about our unique and 
[innovative invoicing solution for GitHub](http://blog.yafoy.com/2013/02/introducing-timehub-an-invoicing-solution-for-github/).

We're thrilled to have been featured by 
[The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/02/10/timehub-lets-developers-generate-invoices-from-their-github-repositories/) along with 
[Techvibes](http://www.techvibes.com/blog/yafoy-launches-timehub-for-github-2013-02-20). Again, thanks to all users who signed up and have integrated in their workflow. It looks like there are quite a few freelancers out there who need to submit time-based invoice.

Timehub allows programers to send good-looking invoices from any repository hosted on GitHub. Simply append commit message with the time you spent to generate invoice from list of commits.

**Update January, 2015: Timehub is now retired**
