June 30, 2010, the day where I finally left my work as Business Analyst/Project Manager to focus on what I've been passively following for a while now: e-business or e-commerce up to you.

Hint, my first project is not 100% virtual but actually requires interaction with brick-and-mortar owners, supports local economy and provides customers with value on a daily basis. More to come. Meanwhile please check out [Koopon.ca](http://www.koopon.ca)

I will be using this blog to relate everything we've been through to make it live.
