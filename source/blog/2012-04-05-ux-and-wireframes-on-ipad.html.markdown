Here are a few early drafts for an upcoming application. All made on the iPad with help from the amazing application, Paper from 
[FiftyThree.com](http://fiftythree.com/)

Can't tell much more for now but it will include mobile payment just like in the Apple Store. Hope to get my hands on PayPal Here for quick integration otherwise will go with Moneris e-Select Plus.
