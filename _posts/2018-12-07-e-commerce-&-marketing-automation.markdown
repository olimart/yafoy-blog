2018 brought a lot of automation in our e-commerce marketing. Not that you are talking with a robot when you are interacting with us, but when you are a small team keeping track of time spent on each activity is important.

**We want to focus on content creation, not on content dissemination.**

On the technical side we are also shifting toward an event-driven approach in the development of our platforms (event-based).

We've also invested quite some time to integrate with Drip. Drip is a great product with a terrible customer support (not recommending at the moment).
However, their product is e-commerce oriented and chose it over Mailchimp for example.

In these days of ephemeral stories on social media, we've decided to step up our email marketing.

With [T•Surprise](https://tsurprise.com) we've made the choice to provide more useful content to our subscribers but also promote our written content ([blog](https://tsurprise.com/blog)).

We've put together a strategy around:
- E-commerce
- Online marketing
- Automation

### E-commerce

People interact online through different channels and on different devices:
  1. Website
  2. Social media
  3. Meetups
  4. …

These people take actions turning into events:
  1. Clicked on link
  2. Submitted form
  3. Placed an order
  4. Contacted support
  5. …

### Online Marketing
> Marketing consists of converting events into conversations (with an old friend).

Since we are all different but share common goals it is important to segment users and conversation types (job interview, first date, long-time friendship, mother-daughter discussion…).

This implies defining for each event:

- Tone of the discussion
- When to respond
- Channel
- Message

### Automation
> Automation is the art of responding wisely to customers as they interact with you

This implies defining some common scenarios and how to engage the conversation in each situation.

**Example**:

When a (new or existing) customer tries to place an order but gives up, I want my support team to follow-up in a timely manner, be helpful, and provide incentive to complete purchase.

Automation results in the creation of sequences to move around the conversation.

**Reminder, when there is dialogue, there is hope.**

We've adopted [Drip workflows](https://www.drip.com/resources/workflows) to document and automate our response to events through our platforms.
