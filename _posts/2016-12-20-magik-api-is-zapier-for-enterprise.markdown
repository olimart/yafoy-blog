Special anouncement. We are currently building an automation solution to help organizations connect their systems altogether.

[Magik API](http://magikapi.com)'s mission is to make it easy create workflows between web apps and exchange data. Think [ETL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract-transform-load) (Extract Transform Load) with a user interface.

We want to help organizations automate tasks between apps and leverage their own data hub.

[Sign up](http://magikapi.com) to learn more. Beta coming early 2017.

**Update 2018 - Due to time constraint (and complexity) this project is postponed at the moment.**
