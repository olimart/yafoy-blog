Yafoy has developed a cut flower inventory management system for flower wholesalers. It's a web-based application (nothing to install) optimized for mobile devices that lets you:

* Track sales
* Direct Sales to florists through trucks
* Sales from warehouse / shop
* Track orders in the future
* Purchases management based on orders and recurring purchases
* Inventory, stock management through multiple storage locations
* Create trash reports
* Flower delivery and flower reception
* This application can be translated to your language and handles worldwide taxes

It currently lets end users update the inventory right from a tablet device, but also lets sales people access the entire stock remotely and sell flowers right from their truck on the road still through iPad or other tablet device.

If you have questions or want to schedule a demo just let us know.
