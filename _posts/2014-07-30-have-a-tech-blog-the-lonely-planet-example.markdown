Ian Feather,Â Client-side Tech Lead at Lonely Planet, recently took the time to reveal some of their workflows and processes to maintain large applications.

To me, this is one of the best cases scenario to seduce and help recruit talented people. His blog posts provide a clear overview of the context, challenges, trials and solutions. Not only, it shows that they clearly keep up with the latest best practices but also explains what they focus on (reduce code, improve loading time...). Let's face it, travel and trip booking industry is highly competitive.

Lonely Planet also maintains quite a few vertical sites but still need to deliver consistency and common patterns. Check out their [approach to CSS](http://ianfeather.co.uk/css-at-lonely-planet/) and [how to maintain a style guide](http://ianfeather.co.uk/a-maintainable-style-guide/).

Maintaining a tech blog is one of the most powerful medium to provide insight and motivation to potential recruits.
