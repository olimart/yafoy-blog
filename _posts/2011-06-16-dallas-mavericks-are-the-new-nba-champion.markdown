A couple months ago, after "The Decision", I
[explained](http://blog.yafoy.com/2010/07/why-miami-will-not-win-nba-title/) why it would not work, why the Miami Heat will not be the 2011 NBA champion. Always easier  to "criticize". Turned out I was right although my other pronostics fell off. To say the truth I was not expecting the Heat to be contender this year. But they showed that they are a dangerous team.

I'm glad the Mavs finally won their first title. It is important because it demonstrates that "Old School Basketball" remains up in the air, you know pick-and-roll stuff and all collective fundamentals. Congrats to Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd and Jason Terry for the accomplishment.
