Here in Canada we speak 2 languages: French and English (or vice-versa). I personally this is an amazing opportunity to unite cultures and develop true personality it also push you to think twice before making any decision.

Let's say you need to come up with company name and website domain name. While you brainstorm you need to keep in mind how the Francophones and the Anglophones will react to it. What does it inspire to them? What's the meaning? Can you make straight translation? I think there are a couple of Â solutions to address that issue.

* Two separate names uniquely understandable in each language.

* One name, same meaning but with an innovative twist (i.e spelling, play on word...)
I personally support option 2 as it helps you build a unique identity from your name. It's also easier to manage however customers will judge you on customer service and value you bring to the table.
